  // ENFORCING OPTIONS
  // These options tell JSHint to be more strict towards your code. Use them if
  // you want to allow only a safe subset of JavaScript—very useful when your
  // codebase is shared with a big number of developers with different skill
  // levels.

  "bitwise":        true,   //prohibits the use of bitwise operators such as ^ (XOR), | (OR) and others
  "camelcase":      true,   //force all variable names to use either camelCase style or UPPER_CASE with underscores
  "curly":          true,   //requires you to always put curly braces around blocks in loops and conditionals
  "eqeqeq":         true,   //prohibits the use of == and != in favor of === and !==

  "plusplus":       false,  //prohibits the use of unary increment and decrement operators
  "quotmark":       true,   //enforces the consistency of quotation marks used throughout your code
  "undef":          true,   //prohibits the use of explicitly undeclared variables
  "unused":         true,   //warns when you define and never use your variables
  "strict":         true,   //requires all functions to run in ECMAScript 5's strict mode
  "trailing":       true,  //makes it an error to leave a trailing whitespace in your code
  "maxparams":      4,      //set the max number of formal parameters allowed per function
  "maxdepth":       3,      //control how nested do you want your blocks to be
  //"maxstatements":  0,    //set the max number of statements allowed per function
  //"maxcomplexity":  0,    //control cyclomatic complexity throughout your code
  "maxlen":         120,    //set the maximum length of a line

  // RELAXING OPTIONS
  // These options allow you to suppress certain types of warnings. Use them
  // only if you are absolutely positive that you know what you are doing.

  "asi":            false,  //suppresses warnings about missing semicolons
  "boss":           false,  //suppresses warnings about the use of assignments in cases where comparisons are expected
  "debug":          false,  //suppresses warnings about the debugger statements in your code
  "eqnull":         false,  //suppresses warnings about == null comparisons
  "esnext":         false,  //your code uses ES.next specific features such as const
  "evil":           false,  //suppresses warnings about the use of eval
  "expr":           false,  //suppresses warnings about the use of expressions where normally you would expect to see assignments or function calls
  "funcscope":      false,  //suppresses warnings about declaring variables inside of control structures while accessing them later from the outside
  "globalstrict":   false,  //suppresses warnings about the use of global strict mode
  "iterator":       false,  //suppresses warnings about the `__iterator__` property
  "lastsemic":      false,  //suppresses warnings about missing semicolons, but only when the semicolon is omitted for the last statement in a one-line block
  "laxbreak":       false,  //suppresses most of the warnings about possibly unsafe line breakings in your code
  "laxcomma":       false,  //suppresses warnings about comma-first coding style
  "loopfunc":       false,  //suppresses warnings about functions inside of loops
  "moz":            false,  //tells JSHint that your code uses Mozilla JavaScript extensions
  "multistr":       false,  //suppresses warnings about multi-line strings
  "proto":          false,  //suppresses warnings about the `__proto__` property
  "scripturl":      false,  //suppresses warnings about the use of script-targeted URLs—such as `javascript:...`
  "smarttabs":      false,  //suppresses warnings about mixed tabs and spaces when the latter are used for alignmnent only
  "shadow":         false,  //suppresses warnings about variable shadowing
  "sub":            false,  //suppresses warnings about using `[]` notation when it can be expressed in dot notation
  "supernew":       false,  //suppresses warnings about "weird" constructions like `new function () { ... }` and `new Object;`
  "validthis":      false,  //suppresses warnings about possible strict violations when the code is running in strict mode and you use `this` in a non-constructor function

  // ENVIRONMENTS
  // These options pre-define global variables that are exposed by popular
  // JavaScript libraries and runtime environments—such as browser or node.js.
  // Essentially they are shortcuts for explicit declarations like
  // /*global $:false, jQuery:false */

  "browser":        true,   //defines globals exposed by modern browsers
  "couch":          false,  //defines globals exposed by CouchDB
  "devel":          true,   //defines globals that are usually used for logging poor-man's debugging: `console`, `alert`, etc.
  "dojo":           false,  //defines globals exposed by the Dojo Toolkit
  "jquery":         true,   //defines globals exposed by the jQuery JavaScript library
  "mootools":       false,  //defines globals exposed by the MooTools JavaScript framework
  "node":           true,   //defines globals available when your code is running inside of the Node runtime environment
  "nonstandard":    false,  //defines non-standard but widely adopted globals such as `escape` and `unescape`
  "phantom":        false,  //defines globals available when your core is running inside of the PhantomJS runtime environment
  "prototypejs":    false,  //defines globals exposed by the Prototype JavaScript framework
  "rhino":          false,  //defines globals available when your code is running inside of the Rhino runtime environment
  "worker":         true,   //defines globals available when your code is running inside of a Web Worker
  "wsh":            false,  //defines globals available when your code is running as a script for the Windows Script Host
  "yui":            false,  //defines globals exposed by the YUI JavaScript framework

  // LEGACY
  // These options are legacy from JSLint. Aside from bug fixes they will not
  // be improved in any way and might be removed at any point.

  "nomen":          false,  //disallows the use of dangling `_` in variables
  "onevar":         false,  //allows only one `var` statement per function
  "passfail":       false,  //makes JSHint stop on the first error or warning
  "white":          false   //make JSHint check your source code against Douglas Crockford's JavaScript coding style
